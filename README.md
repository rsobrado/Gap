## Mattress Shop Page
Create a single page application using the data provided in mattresses.json to populate the mattress data in the application.

Feel free to use whichever framework you feel is best.

### Requirements:
The design should match the mock as best as possible.
You can use a design system (ex. Bootstrap) if preferred.
Use a cart icon of your choice.
The user should have the ability to toggle between mattresses.
As the mattress selection changes:
the selected mattress name and price should be reflected below the mattress toggle.
the selected mattress image should be reflected to the left of the configuration area (images files can be found in /images)
The "Add to Cart" button should increment the cart item count (in the top right of the view)
The application you create should be responsive though we have only provided the design for the desktop experience. You are responsible for deciding how the application will scale to a mobile experience. This is your opportunity to be creative.
Use fonts 'Source Serif Pro' for the "Choose Your Mattress" header and 'Questrial' for body copy. These can be found on google fonts website.
### Bonus Points:
Use a css preprocessor if you prefer **sass** or less. √. 
Display the Review Rating for the selected mattress. √. 
Add animation where you see fit. √. 
Add your own flair to the design. √ (try switching your system dysplay: dark mode / light mode). 
Add a unit test for the "Add to Cart" functionality.  

## 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
